In her solo career so far, which has been active since 2001, she has released six studio albums – all six ranked among the Top 5 on the gospel music charts.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how much wealth this Grammy Award-winning singer has accumulated so far? How rich Dorinda Clark-Cole is? According to sources, it is estimated that the total amount of Dorinda Clark-Cole’s net worth, as of early 2017, is over $7 million, acquired largely through her singing career which has been active since the 1970s.</p><h3>Dorinda Clark-Cole Net Worth $7 million</h3><p>Dorinda was born the fourth of five daughters to Elbert and Dr. Mattie Moss-Clark, a gospel choir director. Dorinda began singing as a youngster, alongside her sisters in their father’s church, occasionally performing their mother’s songs. Simply named The Clark Sisters, the group released their debut album “Jesus Has a Lot To Give” in 1973, and in the following year they gained nationwide attention after “Dr. Mattie Moss Clark Presents The Clark Sisters” hit the charts under the Sound of Gospel Records label. These ventures provided the basis for Dorinda Clark-Cole’s net worth.</p><p>The real breakthrough in Dorinda’s music career occurred in 1980, when she and her sisters released the live album “Is My Living In Vain” which then spent the entire year on the Billboard’s Gospel Music chart, peaking at No. 1. This album featured several hit singles, including “Speak Lord”, “Now Is The Time” as well as “Expect Your Miracle” which is still, over 20 years later, a staple in churches all over the states. Their eighth studio album, released in 1981 – “You Brought the Sunshine” includes “Overdose of the Holy Ghost” song which was performed by Dorinda and showed the full dexterity of her unique and “jazzy” voice. It is certain that all these ventures have massively contributed to the overall size of Dorinda Clark-Cole’s wealth.</p><p>With her sisters, Dorinda Clark-Cole released 20 studio albums and was honored with three Grammy Awards in 2008. However, in 2002 she released her debut, self-titled solo album, which produced one hit single “I’m Coming Out” and brought Dorinda two rewards – Soul as well as Stellar Award. Her second solo album “The Rise of Gospel” was released in 2005, and was immediately honored with a Grammy Award Nomination as well as with two Stellar Awards. In her solo career, Dorinda Clark-Cole has released six studio albums so far, of which the most recent is “Living It” which hit the charts in 2015 and peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard’s Gospel Chart. Doubtlessly, all these ventures have helped Dorinda Clark-Cole to increase the total amount of her net worth by a large margin.</p><p>Apart from singing, Dorinda Clark-Cole had also served as a TV and radio host, featuring in her own Dorinda Show as well as in “Celebrate on the Road”, “How Sweet the Sound” and “Serving Up Soul with Dorinda Clark-Cole”.</p><p>When it comes to her personal life, Dorinda Clark-Cole is married to Elder Gregory Cole with whom she has two children.
