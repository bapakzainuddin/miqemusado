The show returns on Tuesday, August 1, with stirring performances that are sure to captivate the audience.</p><p>Fortunately, there are still two Golden Buzzers left, one for the entire group and one for Sofia Vergara. With a total of 15 competitors, week eight auditions feature the usual mix of internet sensations, acrobats, international parodies, and vocalists. In particular, 'AGT' audiences can anticipate getting to know the animated band 'Noodle and Bun' in the upcoming episode.</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>'AGT: Fantasy League' fans furious after Howie Mandel awards his Golden Buzzer to Ramadhani Brothers despite Sheldon Riley's 'best' act</a></p><h2 class=split>Who are Noodle and Bun?</h2><p>The adventures of Noodle, a wobbling cat who causes mischief, Bean, a pug who whimpers in the face of danger, and Bun, a small mouse who holds this odd bunch together, are followed in 'Noodle and Bun', a 3D computer-generated, non-verbal comedy for children aged 6 to 12.</p><p>Noodle and Bun rose to fame in 2020 through a series of online videos, centered around Noodle and his friends, primarily Bun. Due to its immense popularity, 'Noodle and Bun' received its own French TV show in 2022. The main characters from the series even participated in 'France's Got Talent' Season 17, with Noodle reaching the finals. The true identity behind Noodle's voice was revealed during the semi-finale performance and it was none other than French singer Mickael Dos Santos. Meanwhile, Bun made cameos in the audience for both his audition and 'FGT' Semi-Finale performance.</p><p>The series boasts 7.1 million followers on YouTube and across social media. It has also been sold to various international platforms, including YLE in Finland, Filmin's SVOD service in Spain and Portugal, the Kidoodle app, Megogo in Ukraine, and airlines like Emirates, Virgin Atlantic, Air France, and Aegean.</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>'That was so dangerous': 'AGT: Fantasy League' viewers 'creeped out' by Vardanyan Brothers' balancing act on NBC show</a></p><p>Noodle's fame extended beyond France as the character made it to the semi-finals of 'Britain's Got Talent' Season 16. But this time Noodle's character wasn't voiced by Santos. 'BGT' Season 15 contestant, Tom Ball, voiced Noodle in Season 16. Ball who voiced Noodle delivered a captivating performance of 'Live and Let Die' by Paul McCartney and Wings in 'BGT' Season 16 Semi-Finale.</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>Wil Preacher Lawson win 'AGT: Fantasy League'?

In contrast to his prior appearances, Bun auditioned alongside Noodle instead of joining him in the crowd, making the dynamic combo into a compelling team. The mischievous pair will amaze the judges and the audience with their lively singing. Notably, everyone will certainly wonder who is responsible for the voices of these animated toy animals after watching Noodle and Bun's riveting performance.</p><p>'America's Got Talent' Season 18 airs Tuesday nights at 8 pm ET/PT on NBC.</p><p><span><b>More from <i>MEAWW</i></b></span></p><p><a href=#>'Learn a little compassion': 'AGT: Fantasy League' fans slam judge Mel B for 'fat shaming' Wes-P as she pushes red buzzer</a></p><p><a href=#>'That act was horrible': 'AGT: Fantasy League' judge Simon Cowell slammed for rooting for Wes P over Grace Good</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRomZ2av6qvwKxkoKekYsGiuMSnq2arlZbAsLqMam9mr5ikeqK%2BxGalqKeUobJurc2dZJutnmKur7XMmquenF2lsrOyzquknqqjYsC1wc1moa6cl5rAbsPIrZ9mrJiatrN5yKeaq52Unq%2BtsYyvpqKblQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./grant-cardone-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Whats the Undercover Billionaire Star Worth?</span></a>
