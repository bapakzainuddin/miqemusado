<span>Kelle Repass</span></p><h1>Are Marlen P and her Partner Anthony Davis Getting Married? Find details of her Net Worth</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Marlen Pizzo famously known as <strong>Marlen P.,</strong> is an American native who is gaining fame and Luxury after getting into relation with one of the highest-earning NBA player <strong>Anthony Davis</strong>. Her boyfriend Anthony played from power forward and started to play in the NBA since 2012. Currently, he is with NBA giants <i>Los Angles Lakers</i> and ranked among the list of most valuable players similarly like former NBA star <a href=#><strong>Jeremy Lin</strong></a>.</p><p>Marlen was raised in the United States, but her father came from the Dominican Republic. Marlen, who stayed with her mother in New Orleans, is now staying with Anthony in South Carolina. Furthermore, there are no specifications regarding her early life and birth details.</p><h2>Relationship With Anthony Davis</h2><p>The gorgeous Marlen is widely popular due to her NBA boyfriend, Anthony Davis. Although the love birds have not exchanged their wedding vows, it almost been a more than half-decade of their beautiful relationship. Meanwhile, according to different internet tabloids, they are soon getting<a href=# rel=nofollow> married</a>. But there are no specifications when the lovebirds tie the knot.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/4/16/SKJBFVF-1587032630348.JPG><p>Moreover, nobody knows exactly when and where these love birds meet for the first time or how they fell in love. For instance, their affair caught the attention of media after the West Coast from Los Angeles. Marlen partner Anthony Davis is extremely private when it comes to his personal life, and has never publicly posted any pictures of his family on social media.</p><p>In a recent interview with <i>Sports Illustrated</i>, Anthony stated that,&nbsp;</p><p>it is apparent that Marlen became a really necessary figure to support my family and while we were in LA she really help out to make things right.</p><p>According to internet tabloids, Marlen P and Anthony Davis perhaps meet in<i> 2015</i>. However, they publicly announced their relationship in <i>2016. </i>Furthermore, the duo is the proud parents of a adorable daughter <a href=#><strong>Nala Davis</strong></a> who was born on November&nbsp; <i>2017.</i></p><h2>Past Affair Of Anthony Davis</h2><p>Anthony Davis is a bit famous name in the Basketball world, and it is obvious he was into a relationship before Marlen. Previously, he was in a romantic affair with Brittney. <strong>Brittney Griner</strong> is a professional player now competing for <i>Phoenix Mercury</i> in the Women's National Basketball League and UMMC Ekaterinburg in Russia.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/4/16/khbcdc-1587032252590.JPG><p>Anthony's ex-girlfriend Brittney Griner later exposed that she is a Lesbian. After that, the couple split, and after their separation, Britney got married to <strong>Glory Johnson</strong>.</p><h2>How Much Does Marlen Earn?</h2><p>Talking about Marlen's income, then there is no sign of her occupation and profession. Therefore it's a bit hard for us to determine her actual net worth. Moreover, she showers in fame and glory through her boyfriend, Anthony Davis.</p><p>Her partner Anthony, previously, on<i> July 24, 2012</i>, had concluded a two-year deal with <i>Pelicans</i> worth <strong>$10.5 million</strong>.

He and his girlfriend Marlen is getting economic benefit from the sponsorship with the companies such as<i> 2 K Sports</i>, <i>H&R Block</i>, <i>Adidas,</i> and<i> Red Bull. Still, the</i> precise sum of compensation as per the contract is not revealed.</p><p>Having a quick-paced rise, Anthony didn't neglect his college. However, he made a <strong>$65,000</strong> donation in conjunction with Boost Mobile to create a new court in his Alma mater high school in Chicago.</p><h2>Branded Cars And Lavish Home</h2><p>Shifting a snapshot into the couple's estate, Anthony maintains a property in Metairie, Louisiana.

Ft land with five bedrooms, six baths, and a swimming pool was acquired by Pelicans Power Forward in 2013, charging <strong>$1.5 million</strong>, as stated by Virtual Globetrotting.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/4/16/zdhbvd-1587032561708.JPG><p>Furthermore, in Los Angeles, they spend <strong>$7.5 million</strong> in renovating his home out in Westlake Village.
