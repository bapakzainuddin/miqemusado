However, Petgrave remains a suspect as the one whose skate caused Johnson to lose a fatal amount of blood.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Also Read</b>:</p><p>Watters also noted that "Petgrave, the guy who kicked him, is a dirty player. He's a Canadian and he was the most penalized player in the league last year."</p><p>The host then mentioned that the incident had been called a freak accident by the team but that the police investigators had not ruled out the possibility of an intended killing.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Also Read</b>:</p><p>But then Watters directly claimed for the case to be a homicide which did not sit well with Avery.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>Sean Avery says kick was intentional but not to kill</h2><p>"Well, to me Sean, it looks like a homicide. What does it look like to you?" Watters posed the question.</p><p>"Yeah, I mean that's a pretty dangerous word to be throwing around," the former player said as per .&nbsp;</p><p>While he did think that Petgrave made an intentional kick, it was merely related to the game and not to cause harm.&nbsp;</p><p>"Did this kid make a movement that was very unorthodox? Do I think that he was trying to make contact of some sort? Absolutely. Do I think he woke up and said, 'I'm going to murder somebody today'? No."</p><p>He later continued, "I saw the leg moves, and it shouldn't have been where it was. But again, it's also an unprovable offense. I mean how can you actually prove what the intent was or whether he- This is, it's terrible because it's just awful, man. I can't even watch it. I can't watch the video back."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/373ee6d2-d061-4463-8779-e21f566aeddd.jpg><p>Johnson was set to marry his fiancee Ryan Wolfe and tragically died at the young age of 29.&nbsp;</p><span class=readpage-disclaimer>Warning: This article contains a recollection of crime and can be triggering to some, readers’ discretion advised.</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRonp%2Bteq%2Bx1qxko52jqLJuw8Ctq56qo2K0psDSZqqcoJ%2BkuaawjJuwZp2oYrupuIypo5qxlad6p7vRZqqasZmjtG60zpyinrFdpbmixcSrZJqckaJ6q7vHp6qopqNisaat06FksJmjYrWwucicoJ2d</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./evan-felker-htm.html><span>←</span><span>Evan Felker - Bio, Age, Wiki, Facts and Family</span></a>
