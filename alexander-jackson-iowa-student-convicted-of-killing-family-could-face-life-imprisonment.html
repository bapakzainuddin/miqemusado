"But we know that is not the case, and now, everyone knows the truth of what happened that day. Alex murdered three members of our family - and that pain will never go away."</p><p>"Being able to give (the Jackson family) a moment of peace and closure after a year and a half of tragedy and hurt - I don't think that makes this verdict any easier on them - knowing that a family member killed and murdered their other family members," assistant Linn County attorney Monica Slaughter said, "but at least now, the healing process can begin."</p><p>Prosecutors said Jackson shot his family after his father told him to get a job or move out of the house. At the time, Alexander Jackson had $30 in his bank account. During closing arguments on Tuesday, First Assistant Linn County Attorney Monica Slaughter told jurors that Jackson could not give police a description of the man who he said had shot him while they struggled over a gun, The <a href=# rel=nofollow>Cedar Rapids Gazette</a> reported.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRomZyaxaK6w56pZqKRmLi0u81moKivkWLAtcHDnqWtZZOku7e1wq2cnWWfm3qstculoKefXZuurrXLsmScp6WhsW6ywJycZqSZm7JutcypqaKrn6O6prrT</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./adriana-laffan-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Adriana Laffan Net Worth</span></a>
