Fans of the show want good television, not paint-by-numbers safe spaces wrapped up in couture.</p><p>And then I saw some promising smoke signals that perhaps, all is not lost.</p><p>Those signals came from Carrie Bradshaw herself. This week, a photo surfaced of Sarah Jessica Parker on set as Carrie cranking on a cancer stick from the back seat of a very shiny car, her perfectly wavy hair framing the beautiful burning butt. Her new co-star Sarita Choudhury was beside her, puffing away as well.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large is-style-default">The scenes were filmed on the Upper East Side on September 13, 2021. <span class=credit>GC Images</span></figure><p>Thank goodness! The ghost of former surgeon general C. Everett Koop might now be haunting the sets, but boy what a bright spot for us romantics who love old-school vice.</p><p>Don’t misunderstand —&nbsp;I’d never touch a cigarette myself. But the fact that Carrie’s still lighting up means that there’s a chance that the reboot won’t be a total drag.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Sarah Jessica Parker as Carrie Bradshaw smoking alongside her former paramour Aleksandr Petrovsky, played by Mikhail Baryshnikov <span class=credit>WireImage</span></figure><p>Why? “SATC” was always a fantasy. Carrie lives an impossibly glamorous life, <a href=#>in a lovely, spacious apartment</a> with a seemingly unlimited shopping budget. More, she’s a writer! In pre-pandemic times, most of the real writers I know used their fancy credentials to elbow their way into parties so that they could fill up on free hors d’oeuvres, and have a one-night reprieve from whatever Fancy Feast crap was on sale at Key Food.</p><p>Carrie being an unrepentant smoker was the most relatable thing about her. This entitled socialite — for whom almost everything came easy — also had a dirty, filthy habit that causes cancer, wrinkles and horrific, graphic smoking-cessation ad campaigns featuring people with voice boxes.</p><p>In other words: Her most trusty accessories were Jimmy Choos, Manolos, Fendi Baguettes and a pack of Marlboro Lights. It was enough to make even this cigarette virgin swoon.</p><p>Sure, sometimes the habit served as a plotline, like when Aidan asked her to quit so they could date. But mostly it was just a delightfully gross character flaw — a nicotine stain on her otherwise perfect visage.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large is-style-default">Her character infamously stopped smoking in the original series. <span class=credit>GC Images</span></figure><p>For those of us who are old enough to remember a more vice-ridden NYC, Carrie’s addiction was also a lifeline to another era of the Big Apple, before it was a perfectly shiny Whole Foods apple (looks great, but tastes like a mealy fistful of nothing).</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large is-style-default">SJP also wore a very colorful outfit for her day of filming. <span class=credit>GC Images</span></figure><p>The show premiered in 1998, five years before the city’s smoking ban <a href=#>went into effect in 2003</a> —&nbsp;yet a cigarette dangling from her mouth remained as ever-present as the group’s bawdy brunch talk.</p><p>Now the real Gotham’s gritty charm has been washed over by a tsunami of boutique fitness spots and juice bars. The city that never sleeps is sterilized and preachy. Wellness porn is everywhere.</p><p>That’s why I love to see Carrie taking a deep inhale, like she’s breathing in all that was once great about New York. If it were up to me, she’d never quit: Carrie Bradshaw will continue to take her cosmos with a side of carcinogens, thank you very much.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Carrie Bradshaw’s stalwart accessory was a Marlboro Light <span class=credit>WireImage</span></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3J7j3Jmam5fmK6zvsieZJuqkZnAqa3WZqqtoZyherS5zqSgp59dnrtuv8SxZJqmlGLBqbGMnKCtsV2nsqO7zq1m</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./410053-carmen-electra-declares-her-year-of-pink-html.html><span>←</span><span>Carmen Electra Declares Her 'Year of Pink' Shortly after Being Photographed in a Distressed State</span></a>
