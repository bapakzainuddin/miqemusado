In it, she discussed her memoir The Meaning of Mariah Carey. And during the discussion, she majorly talked about her relationships with her birth family.</p><p class=MsoNormal>In her family, she had her mom Patricia, and her ex-siblings, namely her brother Morgan and her sister <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Alison</a>. Mariah’s father was Alfred and he died in the year 2002.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/mariah-f.jpg><p class=MsoNormal>Mariah, 50 said:</p><p class=MsoNormal>“I would never have spoken a word about anybody in my life -and I tried to be very fair –but people have drawn first blood with me historically.”</p><p class=MsoNormal>Mariah was referring to the fact that her siblings have been talking ill about her to the media for money. She added:</p><p class=MsoNormal>“I know you understand this: When there are people that are in any way connected to you as a person that has achieved any success, you are a target. You’re vulnerable.”</p><h2 class=MsoNormal><span class=ez-toc-section id=More_about_Mariah%E2%80%99s_discussion_about_her_immediate_family></span>More about Mariah’s discussion about her immediate family<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/mariah-p.jpg><p class=MsoNormal>Mariah went on to explain the reason for her writing their stories in her memoir. She said:</p><p class=MsoNormal>“But I wouldn’t have gone here if things hadn’t been done to me. If I hadn’t been dragged by certain people and treated like an ATM machine with a wig on. All it is like: Let me get some money-and to let me get some money no matter what.”</p><p class=MsoNormal>Her family was probably exploiting her for her fame and money. She was a misfit in the family. She had a white mother and a black father.</p><p class=MsoNormal>And her older siblings always resented her. Besides, she has a wide age gap with her older siblings. Her light skin and hair also brought hate from them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/mariah-ts.jpg><h2 class=MsoNormal><span class=ez-toc-section id=Mariah%E2%80%99s_early_childhood></span>Mariah’s early childhood<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p class=MsoNormal>She spoke about the trauma and violence she suffered in her early childhood. Her parents divorced when she was just 3 years of age. Additionally, her elder brother was of the violent type.</p><p class=MsoNormal>And her sister was a troublemaker for her. Mariah said:</p><p class=MsoNormal>“And I tried to be thoughtful about that [description]-although I don’t know that the same courtesy has been extended to me from anybody that caused certain traumatic events in my life.”</p><p class=MsoNormal>Alison had served Mariah with cocaine, had given her third-degree burns, and also once tried to sell her to a pimp. Mariah said:</p><p class=MsoNormal>“We don’t even know each other. We didn’t grow up together.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/mariah-dm.jpg><p class=MsoNormal>Morgan is 10 years older and Alison is 8 years older than Mariah. She said that by the time she was born, they were already in a bad shape and damaged. Moreover, she felt like an alien in her own family. Later, she got famous and they started viewing her as an easy way to procure money from.</p><p class=MsoNormal>Mother Patricia neglected her from her childhood days. She left her in unsafe hands. And she used to emotionally trouble little Mariah. They all had envy towards Mariah as she was always taking care of the family despite being the youngest in the household.</p><p><a href=#>Mariah Carey’s complete bio read here</a></p><p>Share this</p><strong>Disclaimer Statement</strong>: Married Biography's editors wrote and updated all of this data based on their best knowledge and understanding. <a href=#>Married Biography</a> does not guarantee these opinions or ideas.
