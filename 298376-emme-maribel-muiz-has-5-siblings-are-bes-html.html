They are one of Jennifer Lopez's twin children and one of Marc Anthony's six. Altogether, they have five siblings, all from the same father and three different mothers, including 1993 Miss Universe Dayanara Torres.</p><p class=dh>Emme's parents were married in a private ceremony held on June 5, 2004, in Los Angeles, California. Their relationship lasted for ten years before their divorce was finalized in 2014. The couple was blessed with two children in 2008, with Emme being one-half of the fraternal twins, including her brother Maximilian Muñiz.</p><p class=dh>In addition to the five siblings, they have three step-siblings from their mother's recent marriage to Hollywood leading man Ben Affleck. Affleck shares his three children with his longtime partner, actress Jennifer Garner. Emme has since developed a close bond with her step-sister, Seraphina Affleck.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Emme's Dad Has 6 Children, and Her Mom Has 2</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Emme is part of one big family made up of many <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/pictures/marc-anthonys-family-guide-meet-his-6-children/>siblings</a>, mainly from their father's side. Emme's father, Anthony, has had six children with three different women, two from each woman. The singer's first child was with his girlfriend, Debbie Rosado. The couple named her Arianna Muñiz, and she was born in June 1994.</p><p class=dh>While they were still dating, they adopted a son, Chase Muñiz. The New York-born singer has been married four times. After breaking up with Rosado, he married his first wife, Torres, with whom he has two children.</p><p class=dh>The first of the couple's two sons, Cristian Marcus, was born in 2001. Their second child and Anthony's fourth is Ryan Adrian Muñiz, born on August 4, 2003.</p><p class=dh>Anthony <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.nickiswift.com/158555/the-untold-truth-of-j-los-daughter/>married</a> Lopez in 2014, and together they had twins, Emme and Maximilian David Muñiz, on February 22, 2008. Their birth drew massive attention. People Magazine even paid $6 million for the first photo of the newborn babies.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Emme Maribel Muñiz Has Three Step-Siblings Too</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>In July 2022, Emme's mother married Ben Affleck, and they automatically added three more siblings to their already-long list. Their stepfather has <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://pagesix.com/article/jennifer-lopez-and-ben-afflecks-kids-meet-their-5-children/>three kids</a> from his previous marriage to Jennifer Garner between 2005 to 2018. The eldest of Affleck's kids is his daughter, Violet. She was born on December 1, 2005.</p><p class=dh>Violet has already warmed up to her stepmom, who she has been photographed with on several occasions. After Violet came Seraphina Rose Elizabeth Affleck on January 6, 2009. She is described as the most outgoing of his children and also tops the mischief list. Despite her parents' divorce, she has remained close to her father.</p><p class=dh>Seraphina is also reportedly close to her younger brother, Samuel Garner Affleck, with whom she spends a lot of time. Samuel was born three years after Seraphina on February 27, 2012. His father, who coached him in the Little League, says he enjoys playing baseball and appears to have a gift for the sport.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/909d25ddf3a95246eca7e155a2e85b5c.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Ben Affleck, Jennifer Garner, Violet Affleck and Samuel Affleck in Los Angeles, California on August 11, 2013 | Source: Getty Images</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Emme Is Besties with Ben Affleck's Daughter</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>The transition to being a family after Ben and Lopez's union seemed to have gone smoothly for all their children. The kids seem to get along with each other. Although Emme gets along with the entire Affleck-Garner brood, a <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/posts/emme-muniz-seraphina-affleck-are-besties-inside-their-bond/>special bond</a> is said to have already formed between Emme and Seraphina.</p><p class=dh>The new siblings have already been sighted having a day out on several occasions, mostly in the company of their parents. Apparently, the duo has a lot in common. One of the most noticeable things is their fashion taste which looks quite similar on many levels. They are both into casual jeans and large shoes.</p><p class=dh>Besides fashion choices, a source also <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/posts/emme-muniz-seraphina-affleck-are-besties-inside-their-bond/>informed</a> Life & Style that Emme and Seraphina enjoy similar music and are "definitely besties." With only a one-year age gap between them, they are basically the same age, and it looks like that has also helped. Their parents are amazed at how well and quickly their bond has developed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/9dffa0824ae02b6568ae29734d7932f3.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Seraphina Affleck and Emme Muñiz at a sephora store in Paris, France on July 25, 2022 | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>Interestingly, it is not just the new Mr & Mrs. Afflect who were delighted by the newly formed friendship. Ben's ex-wife, Garner, is also pleased that her daughter, Seraphina, has found a friend in Emme. Overall, all five kids seem to look out for each other, which has helped form a good dynamic in the blended family.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Jennifer Lopez Introduced Emme as "They" during the LA Dodgers Blue Diamond Gala</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Emme has performed on stage with their mother on a number of occasions, including in the prestigious halftime show at the Super Bowl in 2020.

Lopez <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.tiktok.com/@christinathesupermom/video/7110247219298602282?is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1&item_id=7110247219298602282">said</a>:</p><p class=dh>"I asked them to sing with me all the time but they won't so this is a very special occasion. They are very very busy, booked, pricey, they cost me when they come out. But they are worth every single penny cause they are my favorite duet partner of all time."</p><p class=dh>After their heartwarming introduction by <a class="me a" href=#>Jennifer Lopez</a>, some fans appeared surprised when Emme appeared on stage, holding a rainbow-colored microphone and singing Christina Perri's hit song, "A Thousand Years." Still, this was an incredible way to announce her daughter's gender-neutral identity to the world.</p><p class=dh>The teenager has a lot of support from their very influential parents and large family, which now boasts eight siblings after her mother's recent marriage. Their father, Marc Anthony, occasionally shares photos of his daughter on social media accounts, telling Emme how proud he is of them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtwcWtna3qmucyeZKaZop6vpriMpqyisl2drrR5lGaqopqcnruov4yaqZ5lkprAb7TTpqM%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./deshawn-murphy-obituary-45-year-old-man-and-dog-found-dead-inside-burning-home-police-investigates.html><span>←</span><span>Deshawn Murphy Obituary, 45-year-old Man And Dog Found Dead Inside Burning Home, Police Investigates</span></a>
