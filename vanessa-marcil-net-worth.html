As of early 2016 it is reported to be $2 million gained mostly from her long career in acting, appearing in multiple successful television shows.</p><h3>Vanessa Marcil Net Worth $2 Million</h3><p>Born in Indio, California to parents Pete and Patricia, Marcil began acting at a very early age, performing in school plays, and soon after she became part of the Circle Theatre Acting Company. While acting she attended Indio High School and later went to College of the Desert, but did not finish her studies, leaving to pursue her dreams of becoming an actress.</p><p>Marcil’s career in television started in 1992 when she was cast in the daytime television drama “General Hospital”. Her role as Brenda Barrett gained positive reactions from fans and critics, and garnered her numerous award nominations. While on the show, she also made movies like “The Rock” alongside <a href=#>Nicolas Cage</a> in 1996 and “976-WISH” in 1997. Although she left the show after six seasons, her performance made her one of the most sought after actresses in the world of television and helped her tremendously with her net worth.</p><p>Right after “General Hospital”, Marcil was cast to play the role of Gina Kinkaid in a new series entitled “Beverly Hills, 90210”. After this show ended in 2000 she made some guest appearances in shows like “Spin City” and “NYPD Blue”, and starred once again in another television hit “Las Vegas”, playing the role of Samantha Jane Marques for six seasons.</p><p>Marcil also made many guest appearances in various television shows, including “Lipstick Jungle” and “Without a Trace”, until in 2010 she reprised the role of Brenda Barrett in “General Hospital”. She stayed in the show for only a year, but appeared once again in 2013 for the show’s 50th anniversary. Her various television shows and guest roles have all helped tremendously in her wealth as well as career.</p><p>Other than acting, Marcil is also a big advocate for various causes. She designed a clothing line for kids called “Kass” after her son’s name Kassius, with the profits forwarded to Africa for building new schools for children. She also started “Patricia’s House”, a home for women who are no longer able to look after their children.</p><p>In terms of her personal life, Marcil was once married to actor <a href=#>Corey Feldman</a>, but the marriage only lasted for four years, ending in 1993. In 1999, she dated actor <a href=#>Brian Austin Green</a> and together they have a son named Kassius born in 2002. A year later their relationship ended. In 2010, Marcil married <a href=#>Carmine Giovinazzo</a>, but filed for divorce in 2013. Today, Marcil is engaged but is keeping the identity of his fiancé private.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=15.036863270777><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Vanessa Marcil</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$2 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>October 15, 1968</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Indio, California, U.S.</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5' 4" (1.63 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actress</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Education</td><td>College of the Desert, Indio High School</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Spouse</td><td>Carmine Giovinazzo (m. 2010 - 2013), Corey Feldman (m. 1989 - 1993)</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Children</td><td>Kassius Lijah Marcil-Green</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Peter Ortiz, Patricia Marcil Ortiz</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Siblings</td><td>Tina Ortiz, Sam Ortiz, Sherry Ortiz</td></tr><tr readability=0.38095238095238><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>www.facebook.com/vanessamarcil.net</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.31818181818182><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.twitter.com/vanessamarcilm</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.21052631578947><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000522</a></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Awards</td><td>Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>Movies</td><td>The Rock (1996), 976-WISH (1997), Beverly Hills, 90210, Spin City, NYPD Blue</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>TV Shows</td><td>General Hospital, Lipstick Jungle, Without a Trace,</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=12.816091954023><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=4><td>1</td><td>What makes a woman beautiful is her loyalty to and her friendships with other women, and her honesty with men.</td></tr><tr readability=8><td>2</td><td>I balance things better and don't kill myself so much, but conflict makes me a more interesting actress to watch.
