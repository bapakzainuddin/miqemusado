I should not be excluded and other people allowed.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Once she was allowed inside, the woman filmed the restroom, which featured graffiti saying, “Zionism = Fascism.”</figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">One of the workers tells the woman that she needs to leave. <span class=credit>StopAntisemitism/X</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">One worker tells the woman, “I know Israel loves taking private property and saying it’s their own.” <span class=credit>StopAntisemitism/X</span></figure><p>One of the female workers blocking her way and trying to boot her then notes that the customer will only see antisemitic graffiti — suggesting she agrees with at least some of the messages.</p><p>The customer is finally allowed in after asking: “If you agree with [the graffiti], why are you afraid that I will take a picture of it?”</p><p>“Oh, actually, great — please!” the male worker says with apparent joy at what she is about to see.</p><p>She then films messages including “Zionism = Fascism,” “Your neutrality/apathy is enabling genocide” and “Free Palestine.”</p><p>“History didn’t start in 1948, lady,” the male worker quips while the patron quickly films the inside of the restroom.</p><p>“Free Palestine. Now, please leave,” one of the women says.</p><p>“Free Palestine,” the man agrees, smiling and saying, “It’s always great. We LOVE it” as she films him.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The worker then tells the woman “We LOVE it” after she views the graffiti. <span class=credit>StopAntisemitism/X</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The restroom’s changing table was also vandalized. <span class=credit>StopAntisemitism/X</span></figure><p>The video quickly went viral, with more than 2.6 million views since it was posted late Tuesday by StopAntisemitism.</p><p>“All three employees need to be fired – this is INEXCUSABLE!” the watchdog group wrote.</p><p>Farley’s East confirmed the incident happened at its coffee shop — calling it an “error” while only saying it had “taken corrective measures with our staff,” without elaborating on what that meant.</p><p>“As context, hate speech graffiti was written in our bathroom. We do not support hate speech; this does not reflect our values,” the coffee shop wrote in what it called “a sincere apology.”</p><p>“After a customer used the bathroom and wished to return to document the graffiti, they were initially denied access and then allowed to enter the bathroom to film the graffiti. We apologize for this error and the distress caused to the customer,” the statement continues.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The coffee shop issued an apology online without explaining what happened to the workers.</figure><p>“We’re committed to ongoing staff training for a safe and welcoming environment. Thank you for understanding that we are a small business doing our best to operate a community business in a difficult environment,” the coffee shop concluded.</p><p>It’s unclear whether the employees involved in the incident remain employed.</p><p>Farley’s East did not immediately return The Post’s request for comment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7kGtmaW9fo7K4v46jnLCho516uLvMmqVmo5mYuKawjKisrWWfm3qkrcWeZLCglaeybr%2FTmp2fZZKWsKx5wKeroquVora1tcJmnquZlpu2tbWO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ian-ziering-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Ian Ziering Bio (Wiki)</span></a>
