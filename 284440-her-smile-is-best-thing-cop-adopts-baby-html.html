Amongst them was <strong class=Xg>a woman he met on patrol in 2017, </strong>who was going through a rough patch in her life. He <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/human-interest/jesse-whitten-adopt-homeless-baby-felt-right/>told</a> PEOPLE:</p><p class=Zg>“She was very honest about her situation, how she was struggling with drug addiction and what was going on in her life."</p><p class=Zg>Jesse often checked up on her as a benevolent man and offered to take her to a shelter. The Santa Rosa cop also drove her to a detox and rehab center.</p><p class=Zg><strong class=Xg>AN UNEXPECTED FRIENDSHIP</strong></p><p class=Zg>Over time, Officer Jesse and the woman living on the streets <strong class=Xg>forged an unexpected friendship.</strong> Jesse recalled that his wife, Ashley Whitten, accompanied him on a ride-along one day, and they ran into the same woman.</p><h3 class=dh><strong class=Xg>The Santa Rosa Police Department joined in the Whitten family's celebration and congratulated them in a Facebook post shared on September 1, 2018.</strong></h3><p class=Zg>Soon, the two ladies started talking about motherhood, and <strong class=Xg>the homeless woman put Ashley's hand on her belly. </strong>As it turned out, the woman was expecting, and Ashley didn't know about the connection she shared with the baby.</p><p class=_i data-testid=image-source>Officer Jesse Whitten with his adoptive daughter, Harlow Maisey Whitten. | Photo: YouTube.com/Good Morning America</p><p class=Zg><strong class=Xg>THE SURPRISING PHONE CALL</strong></p><p class=Zg>According to PEOPLE, the woman gave a photo of her ultrasound to Officer Jesse and asked if he and Ashley would adopt her baby. Jesse didn't know how serious she was until she delivered the baby on February 9, 2018.</p><p class=Zg>Despite trying to stay clean, the woman's baby girl was born with heroin traces in her system. Because she was homeless and the baby had drugs in her system, the county asked her if she wished to arrange for emergency placement in foster care.</p><p class=Zg>Instead, she told them to call Officer Jesse. So on Valentine's Day in 2018, the Whittens received a call that said <strong class=Xg>the biological mom specifically wanted them to adopt her baby.</strong></p><p class=_i data-testid=image-source>Ashley and Jesse Whitten with their adoptive daughter, Harlow Maisey Whitten. | Photo: YouTube.com/Good Morning America</p><p class=Zg><strong class=Xg>WELCOMING AN ANGEL</strong></p><p class=Zg>Ashley shared that the woman had envisioned a perfect life for her child, but she couldn't give it to her because of her condition. She trusted Officer Jesse would do what she couldn't. The California cop shared he couldn't be happier.

She knew right away that she was safe."</p><p class=Zg><strong class=Xg>On August 30, 2018, Jesse and Ashley officially welcomed Harlow Maisey Whitten</strong> into their hearts and home.
