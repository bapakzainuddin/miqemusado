A British woman shared her disastrous experience of her plunging cleavage stealing the show at her son’s seventh birthday last month — and the hate she’s received because of it.
Raquel Dicuru — a 37-year-old mother from Kent — hosted her son’s b’day bash and later noticed that her chest was unintentionally put on display.
After her sister-in-law filmed her lighting the candles on the birthday cake, she saw unintended cleavage appear in her purple dress in front of several rambunctious kids."><meta name=author content="Kelle Repass"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Another added: “Women ALWAYS know when they’re hanging out.”</p><p>“Not smart enough to wear something at a kid’s party. She must be looking for a single dad,” one person wrote.</p><p>Dicuru told South West News Service she was just simply “living in the moment and singing happy birthday to my son.”</p><p>“I just thought it was funny that we were all unaware [of my cleavage] and I posted it online because I thought it was funny and got a shock when I saw the reaction,” she continued.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Many haters — mainly men — slammed the mother of two for her wardrobe choice. <span class=credit>Kennedy News and Media</span></figure><p>“It’s like when people walk out of a toilet with paper hanging onto their shoe. It’s funny,” the assistant ability consultant joked.</p><p>Dicuru also looked back at the hateful comments she received after posting her TikTok, explaining they were “angry” and “they thought it was outrageous.”</p><p>“They were questioning what sort of person I was, if I was looking for a husband,” Dicuru said, adding that she’s happily married.</p><p>The comments posted were mostly from men, however, she also had people defending her and telling the trolls to “lighten up.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Dicuru doesn’t care for the trolls and will continue to wear what she wants. <span class=credit>Kennedy News and Media</span></figure><p>One person had written: “Sorry, don’t see anything wrong. If you go to the beach, you see a lot more flesh,” while another said: “Why is everyone hating…it’s just a basic sundress?”</p><p>“Wow, some of these comments. It’s a funny situation, folks. Life happens and they are just boobs. Laugh a little,” another supporter said.</p><p>But the Brit doesn’t “mind too much” regarding her critics as “these people don’t know me. If they knew me, they’d know I’m not like that.”</p><p>While Dicuru won’t stop wearing the clothes she wants to, she did question her wardrobe choices after reading the hate.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">She noted that the hot June day was too scorching to wear anything else and she chose the lilac sundress to feel comfortable. <span class=credit>Kennedy News and Media</span></figure><p>She revealed: “Deep down, the harsh comments did make me question what I wear. But then I thought ‘No, they’re the ones who have a problem with it.’ “</p><p>“It’s funny how people are angry at skin. Half of the world has boobs. I don’t know why it’s so taboo,” she continued. “This hasn’t put me off wearing the sundress. I’m not indecent — I like to dress nice for the body that I have.”</p><p>Dicuru then pointed out that “nobody should be shaming me or anybody else for what we wear or what we want to show.”</p><p>“I’m just showing a bit of boob or a bit of a leg,” she said. “It’s hot, I don’t have to cover up so that other people can be comfortable.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3N7j3BmanBforyuedKasKxlk6GyosLAoJxmq6SkuaZ506GcZqugpMGttcahq2aeoqS6br%2FOp6pmmpmnwamwwLJm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./marcy-lafferty-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Marcy Lafferty Net Worth</span></a>
