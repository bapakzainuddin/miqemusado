Remy Ma recently took to Instagram to <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/tv/CAaq-vxD62h/>post a short video</a> in which her daughter recognizes every part of her body while her parents call the names out.</p><p class=fh>To be able to do that is an adorable and important moment for kids, and Remy Ma could not resist to share it on her social media. In the post she wrote that the little girl brings them so much joy to their lives, while joking that they, as parents, seem to be annoying her. <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/tv/CAaq-vxD62h/>She also captioned:</a></p><p class=fh>“...do not start calling me talking bout how much y’all miss her and need to see her cuz y’all annoying too LOL!</p><p class=fh><strong class=dh>GOLDEN CHILD</strong></p><p class=fh>Little Reminisce, their first child together, was born in December 2019 after a <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.etonline.com/remy-ma-welcomes-baby-girl-with-papoose-after-tough-labor-115892>“tough labor”</a>, according to what Papoose said on his social media at the time. It was great news for the couple after Remy Ma had to struggle with fertility issues and a miscarriage in 2016.</p><p class=fh>Since the girl was born, her parents call her “<a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.essence.com/love/remy-ma-and-papoose-show-us-just-why-they-call-their-baby-girl-the-golden-child/>The Golden Child</a>”. On social media, Remy Ma has shared several times why they call her like that. When Reminisce was 4-months-old her <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/BxM_LG_DTiw/>mom posted</a> that the girl could say “hi” using the same cadence as hers, and that she would fold her hands and be focused while watching her favorite show, Mickey Mouse Clubhouse.</p><p class=fh>Last year, the proud parents threw a <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.bet.com/style/living/2019/12/19/reminisce-mackenzie-1st-birthday-party.html>fabulous party</a> filled with candies, custom cakes and sweet treats galore to celebrate Reminisce’s first birthday. Remy also has a son, Jayson, from a previous relationship, and Papoose has three other children.</p><p class=fh><strong class=dh>LOVE FROM JAIL</strong></p><p class=fh>Remy Ma and Papoose’s love story is one of a kind: they got married in May 2008, while she <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/12/15/remy-ma-papoose-marriage-jail-prison-relationship/>was in prison</a>.

After that first year or two I was like, 'Alright, it’s no need for me to worry anymore; he’s definitely in it for the long run.’ And it’s obvious how much he loves me. I never have to question that," Remy <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://madamenoire.com/470643/remy-ma-and-papoose-share-their-love-story/>said</a> in an interview.</p><p class=fh>Remy has also said how much she learned from her <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://madamenoire.com/470643/remy-ma-and-papoose-share-their-love-story/>time in prison</a>, and the life she managed to built there.
