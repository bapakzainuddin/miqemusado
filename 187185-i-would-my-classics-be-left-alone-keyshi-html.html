Many found the viral remix and its accompanying video amusing. Others deemed it ridiculous.</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>Genasis first made headlines when he suspected Cole was his hater who instigated the deletion of his “Never Knew” video on YouTube.</strong></h3><p class=dh>The Grammy-nominated singer voiced out her opinion on a recent episode of her show, “One on One with Keyshia Cole.” While she acknowledges the trend of revivals and loves other people singing her songs (aka Cardi B, Trey Songz, and Bruno Mars), she took offense at Genasis for being inconsiderate and tampering with her work.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/53fbe366f22b7b4abc9836e111bdfa95680401577103035.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>O.T. Genasis at the 2019 BET Awards. | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>Cole accused the “Push It” rapper of changing the lyrics of her song, blurring the lines of whether she should be paid for it or not. She also didn’t appreciate that Genasis never reached out to her about his plans regarding her music nor sent her a check for it.</p><p class=dh>“I think it’s just kind of hurtful as an artist,” Cole <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/B6RQL9FAizW/>said</a>. “There was no, ‘Hey how you doing? What’s up? How you feel about this?’”</p><p class=dh>Cole explains that she’s at a point in her career when she’s trying to get her music back to where it used to be but Genasis’ remix just made it difficult. This is because people would never listen to her music the same way again.</p><p class=dh>As such, the singer <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/B6RQL9FAizW/>said</a>, “I really would like my classics to be left alone.”</p><p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>GENASIS' REACTION</strong></h3></p><p class=dh>Genasis first made headlines when he suspected Cole was his hater who instigated the deletion of his “Never Knew” video on YouTube. <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.tmz.com/2019/12/18/ot-genasis-side-eye-keyshia-cole-cover-never-knew-removed-youtube/>TMZ</a> reported that the rapper warned that it Cole was involved, he’d let the world know.</p><p class=dh>At the time, the publication stated that Cole admitted to liking Genasis’ cover of her song and even found it funny. But that doesn’t seem to be the case now.</p><p class=dh>Upon learning of Cole’s new comments, Genasis took to his Instagram and shared the clip from her show. He then <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/p/B6RQL9FAizW/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading">wrote</a>, "Damn Keyshia it’s like dat? I thought u was from da Bay ? I thought it was California love."</p><p class=dh>Genasis later said that his remix was all in the spirit of fun and that it even encouraged listeners to listen to “Love” again.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmpvcGloanqqedaorKWcXaLGbq%2FLmqqsoZOoeqOxjKWcn6xdlrmwusRmop6xo522b7TTpqM%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./joe-mazzilli-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Joe Mazzilli Net Worth</span></a>
