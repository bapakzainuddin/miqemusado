<span>Kelle Repass</span></p><h1>NFLs Michael Oher Is a Married Man but He Likes to Keep His Wifes Identity Private</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>With the help of his adoptive parents, Sean Tuohy and Leigh Anne Tuohy, Michael Oher overcame <a href=# rel="follow noopener">childhood hardships</a> to become a recognized professional NFL player. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-181 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">first played professionally</a> for&nbsp;the Baltimore Ravens in the&nbsp;2009 NFL Draft.</p><p>After winning the 2013 Superbowl&nbsp;with the Ravens, he played for the Tennessee Titans for four&nbsp;years and then for the Carolina Panthers in a two-year contract.</p><p>Oher is now leading a secluded life&nbsp;away from the spotlight.&nbsp;Other than&nbsp;the&nbsp;infamous <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">2017 Uber incident</a> in which he was involved, there is little to no information about his private life, including his&nbsp;wife and kids.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-182 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Recently&nbsp;though, there was a confusion of sorts regarding Oher's spouse, which happened to be completely misconstrued.</p><h2>Is Michael Oher Married to Tabitha Soren?</h2><p>There has been much confusion regarding Oher's spouse. If one were to search for Oher's wife in Google, one of the search results yields the name, Tabitha Soren.</p><p>And while Soren is related to him indirectly, she is, however, not his spouse. So who&nbsp;is Tabitha Soren, then? <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-183 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Soren is an American fine art&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">photographer</a>&nbsp;and a former reporter for NBC and ABC. She&nbsp;is, in fact, the spouse of American financial journalist Michael Lewis.</p><p></p><p><strong>Tabitha Soren with her husband Michael Lewis, author of 'The Blind Side.'&nbsp;</strong>(Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-184 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Lewis is also the&nbsp;author&nbsp;of the 2006 book&nbsp;The Blind Side&nbsp;based on Oher's tainted childhood, his adoption into the Tuohy family, and his&nbsp;rise&nbsp;as a football player.</p><p>The book then became the basis for the 2009 film of the same name.&nbsp;</p><h2>Information about Michael Oher's Real Wife and Kids</h2><p>Oher's actual wife remains rather anonymous, to say the least. There is very little&nbsp;information about his spouse and&nbsp;his kids in public. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-185 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>That being said, she manages a private Instagram account that goes by the username @7tiff4tiff. Besides that, many sources claim that Oher's wife is Tiffany Michelle Roy.</p><p>On August 10, 2015,&nbsp;Sean Tuohy Jr.,&nbsp;Director of football operations for UCF Football, posted&nbsp;a picture on Instagram that revealed Oher's wife's face.</p><p>The picture also featured&nbsp;Oher,&nbsp;Leigh Anne Tuohy,&nbsp;Collins Tuohy Smith, Sean Tuohy, and Tuohy Jr.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-623 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><p><strong>Michael Oher and his wife, Tiffany Michelle Roy (at the left wearing a black t-shirt) with the&nbsp;Tuohy family. </strong>(Source: Sean Tuohy's Instagram)</p><p>Oher was adopted by&nbsp;the&nbsp;Tuohy family, to be precise, by&nbsp;Tuohy and his&nbsp;spouse, Anne. Therefore, the&nbsp;former <a href=# rel=follow>NFL player</a> and Tiffany still manage a good bond with the&nbsp;Tuohy family. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-187 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In another instance, Oher's spouse broke into the news&nbsp;when Oher was involved in an infamous&nbsp;Uber incident.</p><p>In July 2017, Oher allegedly attacked an Uber driver while drunk. According to the driver named Girma Berkessa, he had asked him to follow the car in which his "wife" was seated.</p><p>Oher then&nbsp;later attacked him when he told Oher that the car they were following was missing its direction. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-188 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The former American football player reportedly believed that the driver was scamming him to charge more money and confronted him.</p><p>Oher appeared for a court hearing later that year&nbsp;in October. However, neither the accuser nor the defendant made their statements publicly available.</p><h2>Michael Oher Brought a Grand Mansion in 2014</h2><p>While Oher may have been extremely careful in keeping his private affairs a secret, some information tended to become public now and then. Case in point: Oher's grand mansion.</p><p>In 2014, Oher purchased a grand mansion in Brentwood for a whopping $1.3 million.</p><p>The mansion&nbsp;did not seem like something a bachelor like Oher would purchase if he were a bachelor.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-4 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>On the other hand, the mansion could also be one of his investments from his NFL money. So, it is hard to make a guess.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGiqqaeiqcBwucicn5qdnGK8qbHRZq6inpVivaqv066pnmWdlr%2BztcSdZKChoqGzs7XEp5tnoKSiuQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lauren-heath-missing.html><span>←</span><span>NC Lauren Heath Missing Update: Is She Found Yet?</span></a>
