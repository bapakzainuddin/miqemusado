In 2019, she reportedly participated in the Miss Washington USA 2019 contest but couldn’t make it to the final round. As per her profile from Miss Washington USA, she has worked as an Operational Manager, Model, and a TV host/reporter.&nbsp;</p><p>Taylor started seeing Wheeler in mid-2020, and on the hours leading up to the January 23 attack, Wheeler texted her that he had shaved his head. As per Taylor, Wheeler cutting his long hair worried her as he loved his long curls. When she came home, she found Wheeler trying to stay normal and calm, but as time went on, he “started going downhill emotionally”. Taylor stated that Wheeler quickly entered into a dark place and reportedly asked Taylor to “bow down.”</p><p>“And I asked him why. And he didn’t respond. He just told me to bow down again. And I told him no. And he immediately grabbed my neck. And that’s when things began,” Taylor recalled.</p><p>Wheeler, who previously played two seasons with the New York Giants, did not react to Taylor’s injuries. When she had touched her face, she found that she was bleeding. She quickly ran towards the bathroom to check and call 911, while Wheeler reportedly stood by the doorway saying, “Wow, you’re, you’re still alive”.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>“I had touched my face.

I have bolts, and steel, and a steel plate I'm gonna have forever in my arm... I'm gonna have...gonna have to deal with this the rest of my life," Taylor said.</p><p>Following the incident, Wheeler apologized to Taylor and announced that he is stepping away from football. From a now-deleted Twitter account, he reportedly tweeted that he is deeply sorry for all the pain and suffering his manic episode has caused to Taylor and her family. However, Taylor has not accepted the apology. When asked whether Wheeler should be put behind bars for his actions, she said, “Yes. Yes. I definitely do think that he should.”&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>former seattle seahawks player chad wheeler plead not guilty to first-degree assault domestic violence for allegedly choking his african american girlfriend last month. but in a twitter post that has been deleted, he apologized for causing her “pain and suffering.”⁣<br>⁣ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Vs35ohZAxr</a></p>— Jenesse Center (@JenerationJ) <a href=#>February 5, 2021</a><p class=end-of-block-quote>&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>Prior abuse case:</h2><p>This was not the first time Wheeler has been a part of domestic abuse. In 2015, he was involved in an incident on the University of Southern California campus where he allegedly punched walls and windows.

Wheeler was later detained by the police but not arrested.
