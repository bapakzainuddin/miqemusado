I’m tired. Little sleep. Sorry. On the other hand, it’s $700 per HOUSEHOLD not resident. So…less," correcting his original calculation, while also reiterating that the promised $700 help for Maui households is far less compared to the alleged aid given to Ukraine.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=custom-cursor-default-hover dir=ltr lang=en>There are/were 13,000 residents of Lahaina. 13,000 x $700 = 1.9m.</p><p>Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii, 🇺🇸- $1.9m</p><p>Ukraine - $113 BILLION</p>— Will Cain (@willcain) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">August 15, 2023</a><p class=end-of-block-quote>&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Why is it so comparatively hard to say and do for East Palestine, Ohio and Lahaina, Hawaii 🇺🇸 and so easy to support Ukraine 🇺🇦?</p>— Will Cain (@willcain) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">August 15, 2023</a><p class=end-of-block-quote>&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>On one hand, my math was bad, it’s 9.1 not 1.9.
