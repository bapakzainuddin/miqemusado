The problems led to the cancellation of three Acela trains.
NJ Transit also suspended trains on the corridor between Trenton and New York, and some trains headed in and out of Philadelphia were also paused."><meta name=author content="Tandra Barner"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Something getting delayed or cancelled. It is what it is,” said the stoic stalled traveler.</p><p>“The big point of New Year’s Eve is midnight, right?

It had already been delayed an hour, and they weren’t buying the new schedule time.</p><p>“A train just boarded that was scheduled for 6:00 a.m. We found a guy from Amtrak and said, ‘There’s no way this train leaves in ten minutes, right?’ He just shook his head and walked away. The train’s not leaving anytime soon,” Chrencik said.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">NJ Transit also suspended trains on the corridor between Trenton and New York on Sunday. <span class=credit>John Roca</span></figure><p>“My problem is the lack of communication. When we showed up we didn’t see the train on the board, had no idea what was going on. Airlines are shitty, but at least when you’re at the airport, the airline is telling you everything.”</p><p>“You’d think a government-funded rail program would run better…actually, now that I say that out loud, maybe not.”</p><p>The delays came as one million people were expected in <a href=#>Times Square for the ball drop</a> — all of them encouraged to leave their cars at home and rely on mass transit.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7kGtmbGlforK1vs5op56mnmLAta3ToqanZZOntrG8y56bZpqpYrumw4yynJqqo2Kyt7GMmqStqpGgeqWxy5qwrGc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./patti-mcguire-discovering-the-net-worth-age-wiki-family-and-biography-of-the-talented-public-figure.html><span>←</span><span>Patti McGuire: Discovering the Net Worth, Age, Wiki, Family, and Biography of the Talented Public Fi</span></a>
