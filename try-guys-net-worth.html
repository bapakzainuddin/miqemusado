In 2022, the Try Guys' YouTube channel was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">valued at $6 million.</a></p><p>So, what are they worth individually? Here are the <a href=#>net worths</a> of the founding members, including the now excommunicated Fulmer.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-gIvpCV jBUmSX">Ned Fulmer —&nbsp;$10 million</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marketrealist.com/data:><p>Fulmer originally graduated from Yale University with a degree in chemistry, before making the move to Buzzfeed, where he started the video fellowship program — and ultimately co-founded the Try Guys.</p><p>Along with his work with Try Guys, Fulmer also released a cookbook with his wife <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ariel Fulmer </a>titled, The Date Night Cookbook.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Unfortunately, after he admitted to a workplace affair with employee Alexandria Herring, in September 2022, he was fired from the group. At the time, he is worth an estimated $10 million.</p><p>"Family should have always been my priority, but I lost focus and had a consensual workplace relationship," Ned wrote on social media. "I'm sorry for any pain that my actions may have cause to the guys and the fans but most of all to Ariel."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-gIvpCV jBUmSX">Zach Kornfeld —&nbsp;$2 million</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Zach Kornfeld<strong> </strong>is worth an estimated $2 million, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The List.</a> Originally from New York, Zach is best known for undergoing hair restoration for the group's YouTube channel.</p><p>He has expanded his income-producing roles to include actor, screenwriter, video producer, and businessman.

He is a comedian, model, actor, filmmaker, author, and LGBTQ+ activist.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-gIvpCV jBUmSX">Keith Habersberger</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Keith Habersberger is said to have the lowest net worth of all the Try Guys at $200,000.</p><p>With ventures like Try Guys merchandise and even his own hot sauce called Keith’s Chicken Sauce, Habersberger could be on his way up. He is also a member of the comedy music group Lewberger.</p><p>As the remaining Try Guys members evict Fulmer from the longstanding group, it isn't clear what the future looks like for them. Will they recruit a new member to take Fulmer’s place or embrace their status as a trio?</p><p>These questions and more remain unanswered for the general public. However, it’s clear that Kornfeld, Yang, and Habersberger want to move on without Fulmer.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae4psDRnpiloaOpe6S7zGilnqxdrLyzwMdoq6uxXZzCur%2BMp5ytZaekv7W0jg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./salt-lake-city-school-district-recommends-four-school-closures.html><span>←</span><span>Salt Lake City School District recommends four school closures</span></a>
