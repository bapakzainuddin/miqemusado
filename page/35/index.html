Oh, oh, oh (Oh, oh, oh)
You were walking on the moon
And now you’re feeling low, oh-oh
What they said wasn’t true
You’re beautiful
Sticks and stones break your bones
I know what you’re feeling
Words like those won’t steal your glow
You’re one in a million
This, this is for all the girls
Boys all over the world
Whatever you’ve been told
You’re worth more than gold
So hold your head up high</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Calle 24 Amor Eterno Lyrics English Translation</h2><time>Aug 29, 2024</time>
