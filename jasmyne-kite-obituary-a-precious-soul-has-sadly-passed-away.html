Jasmyne, a bright fourth-grade student at Wells Elementary School, tragically lost her life to viral myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle triggered by the flu.</p><p>The heartbreaking news comes as a stark reminder of the severity of the flu, and health officials are urging parents to be vigilant not only about influenza but also about the concurrent threats of COVID-19 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). According to ECU Health Medical Center in Greenville, there were between 80 and 90 positive cases of COVID-19 and RSV in children last week, along with over 370 positive flu cases.</p><p>In an emotional interview with WITN, Jasmyne’s father emphasized the family’s desire to educate others about the potential severity of the flu in young individuals. ECU Health’s pediatrician-in-chief, Matthew Ledoux, highlighted the vulnerability of children to such infections, stating, “Their systems are pretty young, and they haven’t been exposed to most of those things.” Jasmyne’s school, Wells Elementary, is mourning the loss of one of its own. The principal expressed grief over the tragedy and announced that counselors would be available on campus to help students process Jasmyne’s untimely death.</p><p>Parents are encouraged to engage in open conversations with their children about this challenging topic. Dr. Ledoux offered practical advice to families on preventing the spread of illnesses, emphasizing the effectiveness of social distancing, mask-wearing, and thorough handwashing. These measures, he noted, can significantly reduce the risk of flu and other infections. Jasmyne was admitted to the hospital last Wednesday, fighting bravely until Monday when she tragically succumbed to the complications brought on by the flu. Her memory will forever linger in the hearts of those who knew her, and her passing serves as a poignant reminder of the importance of vigilance and preventative measures to protect our children from the relentless threats posed by infectious diseases.</p>0<span class=mashsb-sharetext>SHARES</span><a class="mashicon-facebook mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Share</span></a><a class="mashicon-twitter mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Tweet</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnqG8t7XNoKSepZ%2Bntqa%2FzZ6urGaTpLpwtsCspLKmlWK4qsDEZqaboaSqrrPFjJpkqaqVmLawwdJmqqitnGK1or%2BMrJidpKlivaK%2F0p6bZpmnlsZw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-mackenzie-dern-divorced.html><span>←</span><span>Is Mackenzie Dern Divorced?
