It’s a very special city and has a special energy — and that we get to call ourselves a part of it is something we are very proud of.”</p><p>The Vancouver-based company now has 2,500 square feet at 138 Fifth Ave. — and has kitted out the space with both old and new materials to highlight its looks. Specifically, the store’s design incorporates vintage furniture and reclaimed oak tables — all complemented by hand-blown glass Bocci lights and tiled areas.</p><p>Backpacks, luggage and travel accessories are also displayed along with the brand’s new apparel line, “Herschel Supply Uniform.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Vintage furniture adds a flair to the store’s decor, but so does Herschel’s own products on display throughout. <span class=credit>Courtesy of Herschel Supply</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">The stylish-looking store opened at 138 Fifth Ave. <span class=credit>Courtesy of Herschel Supply</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">The label hails from the brothers’ native Canada. <span class=credit>Courtesy of Herschel Supply</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">The store’s final look is mod and fun. <span class=credit>Courtesy of Herschel Supply</span></figure><p>“Bags need to be utilitarian and have the feature sets New Yorkers need, especially during their commutes,” Cormack said. Their designs, he added, revolve around what people carry every day.</p><p>And while the stylish bags have a vintage aesthetic, they have “thoughtfully” included features such as laptop holders. ‘They have all the modern sensibilities,” he said.</p><p>Expanding to the Big Apple for its first US location was a no-brainer, as Cormack said this is the brand’s top city for e-commerce.</p><p>“We see it every day in our digital data,” he said. “We will introduce our brand to people who have never heard of it before and our fans [can see our products].”</p><p>Cormack was living in the mountains of Banff, Alberta, when the brothers decided to focus on bags that were neither luxury nor cheap. “Bags were boring and we are trying to get them to be more and more exciting,” Cormack added, and the company has even licensed artist images from Andy Warhol, Jean-Michel Basquiat and Keith Haring. “But we also work with lesser-known artists and they use our bags as their literal canvas.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">A-list fans of Herschel include Chris Hemsworth. <span class=credit>chrishemsworth/Instagram</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Kristen Stewart is also known to tote a Herschel bag. <span class=credit>GC Images</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Even Ryan Gosling is a fan. <span class=credit>SplashNews.com</span></figure><p>Still, the brothers also know that, sometimes, flying under the radar is better — especially while commuting on public transportation. “We want our products to be non-descript and not in your face all the time, so they have a subdued look and … complement their [owners’] individuality.”</p><p>Some celebs known for their individuality, and spotted with their styles, include Chris Hemsworth, Kristen Stewart, Jenna Fischer, Vanessa Hudgens and Lucy Hale.</p><p>The new store also has a dedicated wall and a cozy lounge area for a revolving artist-in-residence program that currently highlights works by local photographer <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kalena P Burwell</a>. There is also a 1,200-square-foot community event space.</p><p>Joe Hudson of CBRE represented Herschel Supply in this lease; the building owner was self-represented.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3N7kGpma2tfnbKzv8KhnKVlo6q9sbjYZqapnZ6oeqrA0madoqqjqXq2v4ysq6iqlWK2r3nNsppo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lea-michele.html><span>←</span><span>Glee Actress, Lea Michele and Her Husband Of Three Years, Zandy Reich Welcomed a Son in 2020</span></a>
