He added of his success, “Now I just want to take a second and enjoy it.” However, the 'Circles' musician admitted his transition from a wild party lifestyle to fatherhood has been a natural process.</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>What is Charlie Cox's net worth?

Instead, he prefers smaller gatherings with close friends, avoiding the wild and raucous social settings he used to frequent. “The difference is I don’t rage in social settings,” he explained. “It’s usually me and a buddy and we just stay up super late until sunrise and were just drinking and sitting out in the car and hanging out listening to music."</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>Who is Alaqua Cox's boyfriend?

I’m such a t**d.’ But now I don’t and it’s been surprisingly easy because this is the stuff I’ve always wanted to do. I’m a homebody.
