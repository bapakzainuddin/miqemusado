The record-breaking “Barbie” movie has inspired a cultural phenomenon, contributing to a&nbsp;pink paint shortage and inspiring a fabulously feminine fashion trend, dubbed “Barbiecore.”
More than just an aesthetic fad, the Greta Gerwig-directed flick, starring&nbsp;Margot Robbie&nbsp;as the titular Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken, has also sparked conversations around mental health and the power of nostalgia.
Since the film’s release, Barbie doll sales have reportedly spiked — much of which could be thanks to adult viewers on a search for their “emotional support Barbies,” reported CNN on Tuesday."><meta name=author content="Billy Koelling"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Men also have some pressure to grow up, but they still have man caves and video games and even Lego sets aimed at adults. Women don’t necessarily get to play in the same way men do as adults.”</p><p>As such, some mental health experts have come to regard the blockbuster as more than just an impressive marketing scheme: The “Barbie” movie’s ability to inspire adult “play” may indeed be emotionally beneficial.</p><p>Kristin Flora, a professor of psychology at&nbsp;Indiana’s Franklin College, told CNN, “We have quite a bit of research that shows the benefits of play for children. But increasingly, we have scientific evidence that play is beneficial for adults as well,&nbsp;especially in the mental health realm.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie in a scene from the “Barbie” movie. <span class=credit>Warner Bros.

And that’s when we start to see confidence really get broken down and disrupted in girls, whereas boys; confidence tends to excel,” she told the outlet. “That suggests that the psychological pressures at that age are really monumental for girls. A sense of play can help buffer against those changes.”</p><p>Previous studies have shown that <a href=#>nostalgia is good for you</a> and can have its own benefits for mental health.</p><p>So, while Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie” has broken multiple records and joined an elite group of films that has all surpassed $1 billion in global box office sales, it has also shaped conversations on girl power and helped <a href=#>bring comfort</a> to women who might have needed it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3Jma25fmrqwwMiopZqkXajCsbzOq6tmmpGnr6qx0maamqZdnrqxvs6vnGaZlKq5tb%2BMppynrJGheqmxwKWroWWgqMaktM6lpqCho6l8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./286482-does-leslie-jordan-have-a-wife-he-once-r-html.html><span>←</span><span>Does Leslie Jordan Have a Wife?
