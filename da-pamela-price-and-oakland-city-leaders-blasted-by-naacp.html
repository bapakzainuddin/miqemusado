No one should live in fear in our city.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Oakland police investigate the scene after shooting an armed carjacking suspect on International Boulevard and 105th Avenue in East Oakland, Calif., on Feb. 17, 2023. <span class=credit>MediaNews Group via Getty Images</span></figure><p>The group, along with Bishop Bob Jackson of the Acts Full Gospel Church, said Price’s unwillingness to charge and prosecute serious criminals, <a href=#>as reported by The Post</a>, has created “the proliferation of anti-police rhetoric and created a heyday for Oakland criminals.”</p><p>The city’s 911 system also is failing its residents, while criminals know police response is usually slow since the city is suffering from a shortage of 500 officers, Oakland NAACP officials said in the letter.</p><p>As of July 16, robberies in Oakland have increased by 22% with 1,880 reports, <a href=#>according to the San Francisco Chronicle</a>.

Women are targeted by young mobs and viciously beaten and robbed in downtown and uptown neighborhoods.</p><p>“Asians are assaulted in Chinatown. Street vendors are robbed in Fruitvale. News crews have their cameras stolen while they report on crime. PG&E workers are robbed and now require private security when they are out working.

How do we solve this? Nobody feels safe.”</p><p>At the Thursday public meeting, Price doubled down on her decision not to prosecute the nine teens for the robberies. She said a veteran deputy in her office determined there was lack of evidence because the victims were unable to identify their attackers.</p><p>Oakland resident Barbara Hoffer, who also was at the meeting, said she was assaulted during an attempted robbery along with her friend.</p><p>“Pamela Price needs to understand that there must be consequences when there are assaults on people in their city,” Hoffer said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3Bma3Bfma5uvMCmnKWZXaW%2Fqq%2FEZpinnF2krqy4wKebZpuZqcZuuMSam56qo2Kvra3SrZydZZKueq%2BtwJynaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ben-savage-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Ben Savage Bio (Wiki)</span></a>
