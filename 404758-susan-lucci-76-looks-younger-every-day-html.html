With a beaming smile, she showed off a designer bag, assuring fans they can choose from various brands to find their "treasure."</p><p class=Wg>However, one aspect overshadowed Lucci's <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CsEaSfkM7yz/>post</a> - her physical appearance. One user mused, "Susan, you look younger every day. The darker tone on hair looks great and makes your face light up❤️." Another fan agreed and wrote, "Glad you darkened your hair. Looks better." A commenter added, "You look glamorous & you darkened your hair! Hair color is flattering!"</p><p class=Wg>The actress auctioned off the purse in her hand to help fund stroke research. She <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CsEaSfkM7yz/>wrote</a>, "Every time you carry it—you will feel great knowing that you are helping save lives—maybe even your own, or the one you love ."</p><p class=Wg>Lucci <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CsDJOm4M-Rj/>partnered</a> with the American Heart Association (AHA) and American Stroke Association (ASA) to "raise funding for more research and to hopefully find a way to treat Stroke even faster!"</p><p class=Wg>She also included a Dolce & Gabbana <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CsBhIS_MvaS/>black hat</a> from Tony Curtis and <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/Cr_KwxfLIEp/>signed copies </a>of her NY Times best-selling memoir "All My Life."</p><p class=Wg>Lucci suffered a near-fatal heart attack. She <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://hollywoodlife.com/2023/02/02/susan-lucci-heart-attack-exclusive-interview/>recalled</a> feeling like having an elephant pressed on her chest. After checking herself in with a cardiologist, they found out that her main artery had been 90 percent blocked, with her other one having 75 percent blockage.</p><p class=Wg><a class="ae -U" href=#>The mother-of-two</a> recovered, but nurses told her she would not have survived if she hadn't acted quickly.

The exercise helped her avoid her cravings for cheeseburgers and french fries. While maintaining impeccable physical health, she shared wise words to live by regarding <a class="ae -U" href=#>aging</a>.</p><p class=Wg>"People look at me and say, 'Wow, she doesn't seem old, but she is old.'
