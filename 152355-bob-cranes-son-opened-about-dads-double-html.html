He wrote that it all began from Bob’s dressing room - which had turned into "porn central."</p><p class=dh>It had been reported that the star used to seduce women in there, and got physically intimate with the aspiring actresses or models. The book also revealed that his father had grown fond of videotaping such acts.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/dd7dd73ff4e8feeff63df32c128635281334711558584019.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Photo of Cynthia Lynn and Bob Crane in 1966 | Photo: Wikimedia Commons</p><p class=dh>"The red light was always on in my dad’s makeshift film processing lab," Robert <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3038975/An-electrical-cord-tied-neck-two-gashes-head-left-fan-blood-ceiling-bed-Son-Hogan-s-Heroes-TV-star-Bob-Crane-exposes-father-s-secret-kinky-life-led-grisly-murder.html>wrote</a>.</p><p class=dh>However, in a more shocking confession, Robert had written that his father had exposed him to one of his "sextravaganza" with a woman when he was only 16 years of age.</p><p class=dh>"She refused to do that on film, but she did just about everything else before my unblinking teenaged eyes," he <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3038975/An-electrical-cord-tied-neck-two-gashes-head-left-fan-blood-ceiling-bed-Son-Hogan-s-Heroes-TV-star-Bob-Crane-exposes-father-s-secret-kinky-life-led-grisly-murder.html>wrote</a>. "This might have been my dad’s clumsy, Hollywood way of having a 'birds and bees' talk with his coming-of-age son, but what strikes me now looking back is that his equipment-laden room was another in a series of tech-heavy habitats that grew progressively darker."</p><p class=dh>The book suggested that Bob had grown used to spending his leisure time developing photographs of actresses and Playboy Playmates, and at one point, Hogan’s set had turned into a place for young actresses or aspiring models to market themselves.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/ff2c1a33bf3529fd6ee8cf992ce0c2e31669651558584132.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Photo of Bob Crane as Colonel Hogan from the television comedy "Hogan's Heroes" | Photo: Wikimedia Commons</p><p class=dh>Robert revealed that his father's unusual way of life went into high gear in 1970 when he separated from his first wife, Anne Terzian.</p><p class=dh>"The impact on my life of my folks' separation was truly the shattering of a dream," he <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3038975/An-electrical-cord-tied-neck-two-gashes-head-left-fan-blood-ceiling-bed-Son-Hogan-s-Heroes-TV-star-Bob-Crane-exposes-father-s-secret-kinky-life-led-grisly-murder.html>wrote</a>. "They had always seemed so safe, so certain. Perhaps they had thought so themselves, complacent that they could weather any storm. The family was conservative by nature, politically and in terms of family values."</p><p class=dh>When the hit TV program, "Hogan's Heroes," ended its run, Bob was expecting to find another television show. He worked in live theatre to pay the bills while waiting for that dream. In June 1978, while on tour for a dinner theater production, Beginner's Luck, Bob was found bludgeoned to death in his apartment in Scottsdale.</p><p class=dh>Robert suspected the killer was his father’s longtime companion John Henry Carpenter, a roving video equipment salesman for Sony.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/bab3ad79cd93bf509a844982259d8bcc1396591558584346.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Photo of Bob Crane and Sigrid Valdis in 1969 | Photo: Wikimedia Commons</p><p class=dh>"My dad had told me that Carpenter was becoming "a pain in the a**", and as part of his changes he was going to end his relationship with him.
