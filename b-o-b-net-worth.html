After he was signed to the Atlantic Record label, B.o.B released his first single entitled “Haterz Everywhere” in 2007, which gained him a substantial amount of public recognition. B.o.B followed this success with the release of several mixtapes, namely “The Future”, “Who the F#*k is B.o.B?” and “Cloud 9”.
