Aged 77 years, Pamela’s life was a tapestry woven with love, family, and cherished moments that will forever echo in the hearts of those who had the privilege of knowing her. Pamela was the loved wife of Brenton, who preceded her in death, leaving behind a legacy of enduring love and partnership. As a devoted mother, her nurturing spirit touched the lives of her children, Matthew & Tressa, and Julie & Darren.</p><p>Her role as a loving mother extended to being a cherished Nan to Nicholas, Adrian, Emma, Amme, Teana, and their partners. The joy of family continued with the arrival of great-grandchildren Lexi, Kaylee, and Benjamin, and the newest addition to the family, great-great-grandchild Riley. The legacy of love that Pamela leaves behind is a testament to a life well-lived and a heart that overflowed with warmth and care. Her family was the heartbeat of her existence, and the bonds she cultivated with each generation reflected the depth of her love and the beauty of her soul.</p><p>A private service was held in accordance with Pamela’s wishes, offering an intimate and personal farewell. The ceremony became a poignant reflection of the life she led, a life adorned with moments of joy, laughter, and the enduring bonds of family. As those who knew Pamela mourn her passing, they find solace in the memories of a woman who was “Too dearly loved to be forgotten.” The imprint of her love, kindness, and gentle spirit will linger in the hearts of all who were touched by her presence. In the embrace of grief, may the family of Pamela Edith Whellum find strength and support from the love that surrounds them. As they navigate the days ahead, may the memories of a life well-lived bring comfort, and may Pamela rest in eternal peace, her spirit forever cherished in the hearts of those who held her dear.</p>0<span class=mashsb-sharetext>SHARES</span><a class="mashicon-facebook mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Share</span></a><a class="mashicon-twitter mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Tweet</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnqG8t7XNoKSepZ%2Bntqa%2FzZ6urGaTpLpwvMCmnKWZXay1prjLrqRmp5Kewbat0bJkmmWTnbKztdKhnJ1lo6TCrXnHmqpmqJGowKawjJqumrFf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nicole-ari-parker-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Nicole Ari Parker Net Worth</span></a>
